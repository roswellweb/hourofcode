<h1>Let's Get Started</h1>
<p>Itâ€™s time to start the Hour of Code here at RHS!</p>
<p>With over 2,300 students, you will all be at different points in your experience with computer science. The app we will be using, <strong>LightBot : Code Hour</strong>, which has many different levels that range from basic to very complex. We hope that you have fun with the Hour of Code!</p>
<p><strong>We ask that all students use their 3G or 4G data during this Hour. DO NOT USE THE SCHOOL WIFI, it will crash due to VERY high traffic.</strong></p>

<p><strong>iOS Download:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Android Download:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightbot.lightbothoc"><img src="/qr_lightbot_android.png"></a></p>
<p>If you are on iOS (iPhone), you can use SnapChat to scan the QR code! Unfortunatlly, if you are on Android, you will have to use a QR Code Reader. Scan the QR code to download the app and start playing from Level 1. If you have coding experience, you can skip sections you are already comfortable with and move onto more advanced sections.</p>
