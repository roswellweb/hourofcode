<h1>Welcome to the Hour of Code!</h1>
<p><img class="img-right" src="/hoclogo.png">The Hour of Code is a global movement, geared towards teaching students the basics of Computer Science, encouraging the students to consider taking Computer Science courses later on in their education. Hour of Code teaches students that Computer Science isn’t just about coding, but about how everyone has the capability to contribute to the ever changing world of technology as a creator and inventor. No matter what each student’s future plans, computers will have their own role in that field. Learning Computer Science gives a better understanding of how much computers are relied on for every day work. Technology is not slowing down, so the only solution is to advance alongside it.
