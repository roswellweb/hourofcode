<h1>Thank You</h1>
<p><img class="img-right" src="code-org_logo.png">Thank you for participating in the Hour of Code here at RHS. This would not have been made possible without the help of countless individuals organizing the logistics of how a massive event like this could work.  Thank you to the VIPs that took the time out of their schedule to make a video personalized for this event. And most importantly, thank you to Mr. Lee who took the strides necessary to make the Hour of Code at RHS a living reality. I hope that you enjoyed your time with the Hour of Code and consider enrolling in a computing class in the future!</p>
